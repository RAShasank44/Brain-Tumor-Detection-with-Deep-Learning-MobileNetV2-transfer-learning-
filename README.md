# Brain-Tumor-Detection-with-Deep-Learning-MobileNetV2-transfer-learning-
This project uses deep learning (MobileNetV2 transfer learning) to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The trained model is deployed with Streamlit, allowing users to upload MRI images and instantly get predictions with confidence scores.
